Let's learn C. This is the first step to learning the awesome C programming language.

## Introduction

C is a general-purpose low-level programming language created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie.
It is used to create system software that directly interacts with the hardware devices, drivers, kernels, OS, databases, compilers etc.

## Learning Objectives :bookmark_tabs:

* How to use arguments passed to your program
* What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
* How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
  
## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Program that prints its name, followed by a new line
1. Program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
2. Program that prints all arguments it receives
3. Program that multiplies two numbers.
4. Program that adds positive numbers.
5. Program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money.
