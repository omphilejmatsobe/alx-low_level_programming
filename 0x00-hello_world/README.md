# 0x00 C - Hello, World üìù

Let's learn C. This is the first step to learning the awesome C programming language.
It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers


## Introduction

C is a general-purpose low-level programming language created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie.
It is used to create system software that directly interacts with the hardware devices such as drivers, kernels, OS, etc.

## Learning Objectives :bookmark_tabs:

* What happens when you type gcc main.c
* What is an entry point
* What is main
* How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
* How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
* How to compile using gcc
* What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
* What is the official Holberton C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
* How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
* How does the main function influence the return value of the program 
  
## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
1. Script that compiles a C file but does not link.
2. Script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
3. Script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.
4. C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
5. C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art, followed by a new line.
6. C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
7. Script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and saves it in an output file.
8. C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line.
