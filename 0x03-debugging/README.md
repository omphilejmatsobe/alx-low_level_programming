# 0x03 - Debugging üìù

Let's learn C. This is the first step to learning the awesome C programming language.


## Introduction

C is a general-purpose low-level programming language created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie.
It is used to create system software that directly interacts with the hardware devices, drivers, kernels, OS, databases, compilers etc.

## Learning Objectives :bookmark_tabs:

* What is debugging
* What are some methods of debugging manually
* How to read the error messages
  
## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. A test for a postitive_or_negative() function.
1. Task to avoid an infinite loop.
2. Program prints the largest of three integers.
3. Program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration
