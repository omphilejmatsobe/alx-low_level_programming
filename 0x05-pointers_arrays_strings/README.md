Let's learn C. This is the first step to learning the awesome C programming language.

## Introduction

C is a general-purpose low-level programming language created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie.
It is used to create system software that directly interacts with the hardware devices, drivers, kernels, OS, databases, compilers etc.

## Learning Objectives :bookmark_tabs:

* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
* What are header files and how to to use them with #include
  
## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that checks for uppercase character.
1. Function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
2. Function that multiplies two integers.
3. Function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
4. Function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
5. Function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14.
6. Function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
7. Function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
8. Function that prints a square.
9. Prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
10. Function that prints a triangle.
11. Program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143.
12. Function that prints an integer.
