# 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings üìù

Let's learn C. This is the first step to learning the awesome C programming language.

## Introduction

C is a general-purpose low-level programming language created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie.
It is used to create system software that directly interacts with the hardware devices, drivers, kernels, OS, databases, compilers etc.

## Learning Objectives :bookmark_tabs:

* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them
* Scope of variables
  
## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
1. Function that swaps the values of two integers.
2. Function that returns the length of a string.
3. Function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
4. Function that prints a string, in reverse.
5. Function that reverses a string.
6. Function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.
7. Function that prints half of a string.
8. Function that prints n elements of an array of integers.
9. Function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
10. Function that convert a string to an integer.
11. Program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme
