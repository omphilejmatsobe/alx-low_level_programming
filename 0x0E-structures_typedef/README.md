# 0x0E - Structures Typedef üìù

Let's learn C. This is the first step to learning the awesome C programming language.

## Introduction

C is a general-purpose low-level programming language created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie.
It is used to create system software that directly interacts with the hardware devices, drivers, kernels, OS, databases, compilers etc.

## Learning Objectives :bookmark_tabs:

* What are macros and how to use them.
* What are the most common predefined macros.
* How to include guard your header files.

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.
1. Header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.
2. Program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.
3. Function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.
4. Function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y
