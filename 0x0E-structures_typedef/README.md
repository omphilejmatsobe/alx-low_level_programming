# 0x0E - Structures Typedef üìù

Let's learn C. This is the first step to learning the awesome C programming language.

## Introduction

C is a general-purpose low-level programming language created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie.
It is used to create system software that directly interacts with the hardware devices, drivers, kernels, OS, databases, compilers etc.

## Learning Objectives :bookmark_tabs:

* What are structures, when, why and how to use them.
* How to use typedef.

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. New type struct dog.
1. Function that initializes a variable of type struct dog.
2. Function that prints a struct dog
3. New type dog_t as a new name for the type struct dog.
4. Function that creates a new "dog" instance.
5. Function that frees "dog" instances.

## Results :chart_with_upwards_trend:
