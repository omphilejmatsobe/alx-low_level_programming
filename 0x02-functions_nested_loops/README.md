# 0x02 C - Functions nested loops üìù

Let's learn C. This is the first step to learning the awesome C programming language.


## Introduction

C is a general-purpose low-level programming language created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie.
It is used to create system software that directly interacts with the hardware devices, drivers, kernels, OS, databases, compilers etc.

## Learning Objectives :bookmark_tabs:

* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
* What are header files and how to to use them with #include
  
## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:
