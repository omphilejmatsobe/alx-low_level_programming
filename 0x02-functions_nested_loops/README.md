# 0x02 C - Functions nested loops üìù

Let's learn C. This is the first step to learning the awesome C programming language.


## Introduction

C is a general-purpose low-level programming language created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie.
It is used to create system software that directly interacts with the hardware devices, drivers, kernels, OS, databases, compilers etc.

## Learning Objectives :bookmark_tabs:

* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
* What are header files and how to to use them with #include
  
## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Program that prints _putchar.
1. Function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase.
2. Function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase.
3. Function that checks for lowercase characters.
4. Function that checks for alphabetic characters.
5. Function that prints the sign of a number.
6. Function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
7. Function that prints the last digit of a number.
8. Function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
9. Function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
10. Function that adds two integers and returns the result.
11. Function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98.
12. Function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.
13. Program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024.
14. Program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2.
15. Program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms in a Fibonacci sequence.
16. Program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2.
