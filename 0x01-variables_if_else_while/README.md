# 0x01 C - Variables, if-else-while üìù

Let's learn C. This is the first step to learning the awesome C programming language.

## Introduction

C is a general-purpose low-level programming language created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie.
It is used to create system software that directly interacts with the hardware devices, drivers, kernels, OS, databases, compilers etc.

## Learning Objectives :bookmark_tabs:

* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
* What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
* What the the relational operators and how to use them
* What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
* What are the boolean operators and how to use them
* How to use the if, if ... else statements
* How to use comments
* How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
* How to assign values to variables
* How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
* How to use the while loop
* How to use variables with the while loop
* How to print variables using printf
* What is the ASCII character set
* What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64
