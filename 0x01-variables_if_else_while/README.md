# 0x01 C - Variables, if-else-while üìù

Let's learn C. This is the first step to learning the awesome C programming language.

## Introduction

C is a general-purpose low-level programming language created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie.
It is used to create system software that directly interacts with the hardware devices, drivers, kernels, OS, databases, compilers etc.

## Learning Objectives :bookmark_tabs:

* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
* What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
* What the the relational operators and how to use them
* What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
* What are the boolean operators and how to use them
* How to use the if, if ... else statements
* How to use comments
* How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
* How to assign values to variables
* How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
* How to use the while loop
* How to use variables with the while loop
* How to print variables using printf
* What is the ASCII character set
* What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64 
  
## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
1. Script that compiles a C file but does not link.
2. Script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
3. Script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.
4. C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
5. C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art, followed by a new line.
6. C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
7. Script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and saves it in an output file.
8. C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line.
